#Interesting Problems!

This is a repository of solutions to some exercises that I have completed from CodeWars or other problems I find online. Additionally, I have created an [interesting_code.py](interesting_code.py) file for the code that I want to look back on later.

---
The following list is semi in the order that I attempted these problems. (Some of the problems are not CodeWars katas but questions that I found online and these will be noted with an asterisk *)

- [interesting_code.py](interesting_code.py)
- [primefactorization.py](primefactorization.py)
  - Find the prime factors of a given number
- [largest_5_digits.py](largest_5_digits.py)
  - Given a string of digits ('2345...'), returns the largest 5 digit number
- [ROT13.py](ROT13.py)
  - Given a string, encodes the string using [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoding
- [long_mult.py](long_mult.py)*
  - Uses long hand multiplication to perform multiplication. Long hand multiplication is how humans are typically taught to multiply by hand.
- [palindrome.py](palindrome.py)
  - Given a number, return the number of special steps required to return a palindrome. The special step is adding the number to its reverse.
