#Interesting Problems!

This is a repository of solutions to some exercises that I have completed from CodeWars or other problems I find online. Additionally, I have created an [interesting_code.py](interesting_code.py) file for the code that I want to look back on later.

---
The following list is semi in the order that I attempted these problems. (Some of the problems are not CodeWars katas but questions that I found online and these will be noted with an asterisk *)

- [primefactorization.py](primefactorization.py)
- [largest_5_digits.py](largest_5_digits.py)
- [ROT13.py](ROT13.py)
- [long_mult.py](long_mult.py)*
